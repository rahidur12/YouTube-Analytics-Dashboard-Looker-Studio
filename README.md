## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a dedicated **YouTube Analytics Dashboard** to transform raw data (likely from YouTube Studio) into actionable insights across three main sections: **Overview**, **Performance**, and **Engagement**.

Key analysis areas covered include:

* **Channel Growth & Health:** Monitoring **Subscribers** (129, $\downarrow 62.4\%$), **Views** (661,233), **Watch Time** (33,686.87, $\downarrow 80.2\%$), and **Like Rate** (0.16%).
* **Video Performance:** Identifying **Top 10 Videos by Views** (e.g., VID\_7) and **Top 10 Videos by Watch Time** (e.g., VID\_9).
* **Audience Engagement:** Analyzing **Engagement Types Over Time** (Likes Added, Comments Added, Shares) and **Views by US State Code** (e.g., NY, MI, IN).
* **Efficiency Metrics:** Scatter plot correlating **Average View Duration vs Views (by Video)** to pinpoint high-performing content.

The dashboard allows creators to optimize content strategy by understanding what content drives the most engagement and watch time.
